# Chapter 02 - かいもの Shopping

## Grammar

### これ　それ　あれ　どれ

Often time, we do not know what to call things when we refer to them. In English, we use words like "this", "that", and "that one" in these situations. In Japanese, the equivalent words are これ, それ, and あれ.

* これはいくらですか。	How much is this?
* それは三千円です。		That is 3000 yen.
* あれは私のペンです。	That over there is my pen.

There is also an expression for the English "which" - どれ.

どれですか。			Which one is it?

Question words like どれ and なに cannot be followed by the particle は. Instead, you must use the particle が.

どれ**が**あなたの犬ですか。	Which one is your dog?

### この・その・あの・どの＋noun

If you want to be more specific than the set of words we just learned, you can use この, その, あの, and どの with the restriction that it must be followed by a noun. The English equivalent of this would be, instead of "which one," you say "which pen."

* これ時計はいくらですか。		How much is this watch?
* その時計は三千円です。			That watch is 3,000 yen.
* あの時計は三千五百円です。		That watch over there is 3,5000 yen.
* どの時計**が**二千円ですか。Which watch is 2,000 yen?

Once again, since どの is a question word, we have to use が instead of は.

### ここ・そこ・あそこ・どこ

Our previous sets of words in this chapter refer to objects. Now, we are going to refer to locations. Our same distance proximities still apply, though.

* ここ  here
* そこ　there
* あそこ　over there
* どこ　where

Here are some examples:

すみません。郵便局はどこですか。 Excuse me, where is the post office?
郵便局はあそこです。						The post office is over there.

We will learn how to give more specific directions beyond your point of reference in Chapter 4.

### だれの＋noun

The word for who is だれ and to make that into the possessive "whose," we simply add の like we did in the last chapter to form だれの.

これはだれのカバンですか。 Whose bag is this?

### noun＋も

In Chapter 1, we learned how to say "Item A is this, Item B is that." Now, we will learn how to say "Item A is this, and Item B is also this."

たけしさんは日本人です。	Takeshi is a Japanese person.
みちこさんも日本人です。	Michiko is also a Japanese person.

These sentences are entirely identicle except for も in the place of は. も i s particle that indiciates that that item also has the given property. In English, the "too" is always placed at the end of the sentence. In Japanese, the も always follows the noun. You should not use も to describe an additional characteristic about the same noun like we would in English - "Mary is Japanese. And American, also." That sentence would NOT be "メアリーは日本人です。メアリーもアメリカ人です。" Instead, it would be a phrase we haven't quite learned yet - メアリーは日本人です。メアリーはアメリカ人でもあります。 Using も should indicate that an additional noun as some same characteristic.

### noun＋じゃないです
