# Japanese Writing Systems and Greetings

## Japanese Writing System

 - There are 3 kinds of characters in Japanese: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji
 - Hiragana and Katakana, like the alphabet, represent phonetic sounds
 - Kanji, or Chinese characters, represent not just sounds but also meaning. Mostly, they are used for nouns and the stems of verbs and adjectives

#### Hiragana

There are 46 basic Hiragana syllables which can be seen in the following chart

| **あ** | **い** | **う** | **え** | **お** |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|   か　 | 　き   | 　く   | 　け   | 　こ   |
|   さ　 | 　し   | 　す   | 　せ   | 　そ   |
|   た　 | 　ち   | 　つ   | 　て   | 　と   |
|   な　 | 　に   | 　ぬ   | 　ね   | 　の   |
|   は　 | 　ひ   | 　ふ   | 　へ   | 　ほ   |
|   ま　 | 　み   | 　む   | 　め   | 　も   |
|   や　 | 　　   | 　ゆ   | 　　   | 　よ   |
|   ら　 | 　り   | 　る   | 　れ   | 　ろ   |
|   わ　 | 　　   | 　　   | 　　   | 　を   |
|   ん　 | 　　   | 　　   | 　　   | 　　   |

An additional 23 sounds can be transcribed using **diacritical** marks which consist of a short pair of diagonal strokes in the upper right of the character or a small circle for change h->p. For example:
 * が (ga)
 * ざ (za)
 * ぼ (bo)
 * ぴ (pi)


Even more sounds can be derived by **transcribing contracted sounds**. This is done by placing a small や, ゆ, or よ following the letters in the i-vowel column. For example:

 * きゃ (kya)
 * りゅ (ryu)
 * しょ (sho)
 * じゃ (ja)

The final way to modify sounds using Hiragana is through **transcribing double consonants**. If you want to write out a double consonant, place a small つ between the first character and the second character

 * かった  (katta)
 * はっぱ  (happa)
 * ざっし  (zasshi)

Note that this only applies to consonants. If you would like to repeat a vowel sounds, simply place that vowel right after a syllable that ends in the same vowel

 * おばあさん   (obaasan)
 * おじいさん   (ojiisan)

## Katakana

The same exact 46 syllables in the Hiragana chart also exist in the Katakana chart.

| **ア** | **イ** | **ウ** | **エ** | **オ** |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|   カ　 | 　キ   | 　ク   | 　ケ   | 　コ   |
|   サ　 | 　シ   | 　ス   | 　セ   | 　ソ   |
|   タ　 | 　チ   | 　ツ   | 　テ   | 　ト   |
|   ナ　 | 　ニ   | 　ヌ   | 　ネ   | 　ノ   |
|   ハ　 | 　ヒ   | 　フ   | 　ヘ   | 　ホ   |
|   マ　 | 　ミ   | 　ム   | 　メ   | 　モ   |
|   ヤ　 | 　　   | 　ユ   | 　　   | 　ヨ   |
|   ラ　 | 　リ   | 　ル   | 　レ   | 　ロ   |
|   ワ　 | 　　   | 　　   | 　　   | 　ヲ   |
|   ン　 | 　　   | 　　   | 　　   | 　　   |

All of the same modifers that exist in Hiragana also exist in Katakana. The only slight difference is to make a double consonant, ツ is used and for double vowels, instead of repeating the vowel, it is extending with a long dash ー.

Since Katakana is used for foreign words. There are some sounds that exist in Katakana that do not exist in Hiragana. For example, The "v" sound is sometimes written as ヴ. There are also additional contracted sounds that do not exist in Hiragana. They can be easily figured out, however, if you know the katakana table being that, besides V, they all use the same characters.
