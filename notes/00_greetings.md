# Japanese Writing Systems and Greetings

## Japanese Writing System

 - There are 3 kinds of characters in Japanese: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji
 - Hiragana and Katakana, like the alphabet, represent phonetic sounds
 - Kanji, or Chinese characters, represent not just sounds but also meaning. Mostly, they are used for nouns and the stems of verbs and adjectives

#### Hiragana

There are 46 basic Hiragana syllables which can be seen in the following chart

| **あ** | **い** | **う** | **え** | **お** |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|   か   |   き   |   く   |   け   |   こ   |
|   さ   |   し   |   す   |   せ   |   そ   |
|   た   |   ち   |   つ   |   て   |   と   |
|   な   |   に   |   ぬ   |   ね   |   の   |
|   は   |   ひ   |   ふ   |   へ   |   ほ   |
|   ま   |   み   |   む   |   め   |   も   |
|   や   |   　   |   ゆ   |   　   |   よ   |
|   ら   |   り   |   る   |   れ   |   ろ   |
|   わ   |   　   |   　   |   　   |   を   |
|   ん   |   　   |   　   |   　   |   　   |

An additional 23 sounds can be transcribed using **diacritical** marks which consist of a short pair of diagonal strokes in the upper right of the character or a small circle for change h->p. For example:
 * が (ga)
 * ざ (za)
 * ぼ (bo)
 * ぴ (pi)


Even more sounds can be derived by **transcribing contracted sounds**. This is done by placing a small や, ゆ, or よ following the letters in the i-vowel column. For example:

 * きゃ (kya)
 * りゅ (ryu)
 * しょ (sho)
 * じゃ (ja)

The final way to modify sounds using Hiragana is through **transcribing double consonants**. If you want to write out a double consonant, place a small つ between the first character and the second character

 * かった  (katta)
 * はっぱ  (happa)
 * ざっし  (zasshi)

Note that this only applies to consonants. If you would like to repeat a vowel sounds, simply place that vowel right after a syllable that ends in the same vowel

 * おばあさん   (obaasan)
 * おじいさん   (ojiisan)

#### Katakana

The same exact 46 syllables in the Hiragana chart also exist in the Katakana chart.

| **ア** | **イ** | **ウ** | **エ** | **オ** |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|   カ   |   キ   |   ク   |   ケ   |   コ   |
|   サ   |   シ   |   ス   |   セ   |   ソ   |
|   タ   |   チ   |   ツ   |   テ   |   ト   |
|   ナ   |   ニ   |   ヌ   |   ネ   |   ノ   |
|   ハ   |   ヒ   |   フ   |   ヘ   |   ホ   |
|   マ   |   ミ   |   ム   |   メ   |   モ   |
|   ヤ   |   　   |   ユ   |   　   |   ヨ   |
|   ラ   |   リ   |   ル   |   レ   |   ロ   |
|   ワ   |   　   |   　   |   　   |   ヲ   |
|   ン   |   　   |   　   |   　   |   　   |

All of the same modifers that exist in Hiragana also exist in Katakana. The only slight difference is to make a double consonant, ツ is used and for double vowels, instead of repeating the vowel, it is extending with a long dash ー.

Since Katakana is used for foreign words. There are some sounds that exist in Katakana that do not exist in Hiragana. For example, The "v" sound is sometimes written as ヴ. There are also additional contracted sounds that do not exist in Hiragana. They can be easily figured out, however, if you know the katakana table being that, besides V, they all use the same characters.

#### Kanji

The third and final type of character in Japanese is Kanji, which are Chinese characters that were introduced to Japan more than 1500 years ago when the Japanese did not have a writing system (Hiragana and Katakana evolved later on). Now, what makes Kanji so difficult is that there are 1000s of them, and many, if not most of them, possess multiple readings which can be divided into two types.

 - **on-yomi** which is the Chinese reading, derived from the Chinese pronunciation
 - **kun-yomi** are the Japanese readings that came to exist when Kanji started being used to write native Japanese words.

For reference, by the time of high school graduation, Japan students are expected to know 2136 kanji, 1006 of which are taught at the elementary level.

In terms of their formation, there are roughly four types of Kanji:

 1. Pictograms - made from a picture
 2. Simple - dots and lines representing a concept such as 三 (three)
 3. Compound Ideograms - made from two or more Kanji
 4. Phonetic Ideograms - made up of a meaning element and a sound element.


## Greetings

Again, I will not be including any Vocabulary here as I am using memrise and hand-made flascards for that.

#### Expression Notes 1

 - おはよう is used between friends and family members, typically before noon but can also be said in a casual setting in the afternoon. おはようございます is used with less intimate acquaintances.
 - There are several goodbye expressions in Japanese with the choice among them depending on the degree of separation. さようなら is used when you don't expect to see the person until tomorrow or sometime later. If you expect to see a friend again fairly soon, you can use じゃあ、また which is basically "see you later." For a more formal "excuse me, I'm leaving," go with しつれいします.
 - すみません can be used to mean 1) Excuse me, 2) I'm sorry, and 3) Thank you to show appreciation for something someone has done for you.
 - いいえ is primarily a "no" response but can also be used as the english "no problem."

#### Culture Note - Greetings and Bowing

Japanese people greet each other by bowing, which has many other functions such as expressing respect, gratitude, and apologies. Generally, the longer and deeper the bow, the more formal and respectful it appears. Bowing is a thing because many Japanese tend to feel uncomfortable with physical contact, although it is becoming common to shake hands in business settings. In these business settings, it is common to exchange meeshi (business cards) with a small bow.
