## Grammar

#### X は Y です

The sentence form X は Y です is used to make declarations such as "It is 12:30pm" and "I am a student."

* 午後12時半です 				(It) is 12:30pm
* 学生です 							(I) am a student
* 日本語です 						(My major) is the Japanese language

Notice that these do not have the subject yet. That is because these types of sentences are quite common in Japanese. If it is clear what the topic of conversation is, then it is okay to leave out the subject in the sentence. For example, if someone asks you what your major is:

Q: 専攻は何ですか。							What is your major of studies?
A: コンピューターのエンジニアです。			(It) is computer engineering

This can be seen in English as well. If someone asks you what your major and you simply respond "computer engineering."

But what if you don't know what the topic is or want to introduce a new topic? That is where our full X は Y です sentence structures comes in.

 * 私の専攻はコンピューターのエンジニアです		My major is computer engineering
 * やましたさんは先生です										Mr. Yamashita is a teacher
 * メアリはアメリカ人です										Mary is an American

は (prounced wa in this sentence) is a member in the class of words called **particles**. So is の, which we also just saw. Particles attach themselves to phrases and indicates how the phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.

Not all particles in English have a direct translations to Japanese. You may have noticed that there is no "a" or plural "s" in the above sentences. These do not exist in Japanese. Without background or context, 学生 can mean student or students.
