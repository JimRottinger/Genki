## Grammar

#### X は Y です

The sentence form X は Y です is used to make declarations such as "It is 12:30pm" and "I am a student."

* 午後12時半です 				(It) is 12:30pm
* 学生です 							(I) am a student
* 日本語です 						(My major) is the Japanese language

Notice that these do not have the subject yet. That is because these types of sentences are quite common in Japanese. If it is clear what the topic of conversation is, then it is okay to leave out the subject in the sentence. For example, if someone asks you what your major is:

Q: 専攻は何ですか。							What is your major of studies?
A: コンピューターのエンジニアです。			(It) is computer engineering

This can be seen in English as well. If someone asks you what your major and you simply respond "computer engineering."

But what if you don't know what the topic is or want to introduce a new topic? That is where our full X は Y です sentence structures comes in.

 * 私の専攻はコンピューターのエンジニアです		My major is computer engineering
 * やましたさんは先生です										Mr. Yamashita is a teacher
 * メアリはアメリカ人です										Mary is an American

は (prounced wa in this sentence) is a member in the class of words called **particles**. So is の, which we also just saw. Particles attach themselves to phrases and indicates how the phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.

Not all particles in English have a direct translations to Japanese. You may have noticed that there is no "a" or plural "s" in the above sentences. These do not exist in Japanese. Without background or context, 学生 can mean student or students.

#### Question Sentences

It is very easy to form questions in Japanese. Basically all you have to do is add か at the end of the statement. For instance, 留学生です means "I am an international student." Bu then, 留学生ですか。means "(Are you) an international student?"

We can also add 何 (pronounced *nan* when before desu or a counter liek ji, or *nani* otherwise) which is equivalent to "what" in English. 専攻は何ですか。 means "What is your major?" Here are some other questions we can ask:

 * 今は何時ですか。 (What time is it right now?)
 * メアリーさんは何歳ですか。  (How old is Mary?)
 * 何年生ですか。  (What year of studies are you in?)
 * 電話番号は何ですか。  (What is your phone number?)


#### N１のN２

の is a particle that connects two nouns. さくら大学生の学生 means "student of Sakura University." The second noun provides the main idea, and the first noun provides the specifier. But a descriptor is not the only way that the の particle can be used. Check out these examples:

 * たかしさんの電話番号 Takeshi's phone number
 * 大学の先生 A college teacher (professor)
 * 日本語の学生 A Japanese (language) student
 * 英語の新聞 An English newspaper.

A phrase of the form N1のN2 acts like one big noun and can be placed into other sentence structures. 私の電話番号は９8５の３７９８です.

#### Culture Note - Japanese Names

When Japanese give their names, they say their family name first and their given name last, if at all.  Most Japanese names are written in Kanji and the family names are often related to nature or geographical features, such as 田中 which means "middle of the rice field." Because many kanji share the same reading, names with the same pronunciation may be written with different Kanji

## Expression Notes 2

 * **あの** indicates that you have some reservation about what you are going to say next, such as fear of interrupting someone, of asking something personal, or of saying something incorrectly. In is like Um.. in English.
 * **Saying Yes** - はい and ええ both mean "yes" but they are used differently. ええ is more conversational when responding to questions, and in informal settings うん can be used. はい can be used in formal situations or to, say, respond to a knock at the door or a call for your name.
 * **そうですか** acknowledges that you have understood what has been said to you. Like "is that so?" in English.
 * Many **number words** have more than one pronunciation. There are many examples of this, but here are some good ones to know.
   * ゼロ and れい are both commonly used for 0.
   * 1 is always いち when its standalone, but is sometimes pronounced いっ when combined with a counter, such as いっさい (one year old) and いっぷん (one minute)
   * 3 is always さん, but occasionally the counter that it is attached to changes. 300 is さんびゃく instead of さんひゃく。
   * 4 is よん most of the time, but can also be shortened to よ when combined with counters such as よじ. In some combination we will learn later on, it is し.
   * 6 is ろく but pronounced as ろっ, must like 1.
   * 7 - なな is the one most basic, but 7:00 is しちじ.
   * 8 is hachi, but usually pronounced はっ.
   * 9 is きゅう and sometimes shortened to く.
 * **Giving one's telephone number** - The particle の is usually placed between the local exchange code and the last 4 digits.
 * **Referring to the person you are talking to** - the word for you, あなた, is not commonly used in Japanese like it is in English. Instead, you should use the name and/or the title of the person you are talking to.
