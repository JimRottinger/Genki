# GENKI: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese

This repo contains my notes as I go through the two volumes of Genki along the way to learning Japanese. The two volumes consist of a combined 23 chapters, with the first 12 coming in Volume 1 and the remaining 11 coming in volume 2. Beginning in February of 2018, it is my goal to complete both volumes by the end of the year. My notes here will include grammar, expression notes, and responses to the exercise and practice sections. It will not include vocabulary. For that, I will be using both Memrise and hand-made flashcards.
